The analysis to be done in this class is only a small part of a bigger project with the National Science Foundation and US Department of Agriculture's program on Water, Sustainability, and Climate (WSC).  We will be responsible for creating time series models for the level of water (in feet) in various wells in Florida.  Each group will be given a well in which they are responsible for modeling.  For time series I, we will only focus on the data from the "Well" sheet (this contains the level of the water in the well measured in feet).  In time series II, we will move onto including information from the "Tide" and "Rain" sheets (fairly self explanatory; all measurements are in feet).  For some of the wells, the tidal information is contained in a separate file.

The information below provides the well and its location (see attachment for picture of location).  Be sure to use the information below about the correct start and stop date (there is a chance you will not use the entire range of data).  The data should be hourly (need to check to make sure that all the data are recorded hourly).  The column that contains the actual series is the column titled "Corrected", this is the column with the correct data (i.e. use THIS data when doing analysis).  When sending in reports, you need to include two files: (1) the report and (2) the code used to create the analysis in the report.  Every time your code is included in the report, it should include how to get the raw data all the way to the analysis (i.e. if there are any transformations and/or imputations, they need to ALWAYS be included!!).  The last report, including the code used for the last report, for time series I will be sent to the group using that well in time series II (so they do NOT have to start from scratch!).

All reports from time series II will be sent to our contact down in Florida and will be included in future analyses.  Be sure your code is easy to read and interpret.
